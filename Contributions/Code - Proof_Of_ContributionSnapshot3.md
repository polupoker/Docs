## Code Provider - Proof of Contribution Table Snapshot 3 March 8th to April 8th 2024

This table is for code contributions in snapshot 3.
See [snapshot 1 & 2 code contribution details](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Contributions/Code%20-%20Proof_Of_Contribution.md#code-contributions-for-snapshot-1-and-snapshot-2).

**Before adding a pull request to this table [please read the BEST PRACTICES GUIDE](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Code%20Contributor%20Best%20Practices.md)**
& 
**[The Code Contributors Weights Guide](https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/Guides/Code%20Contributor%20Weights%20Guide.md)**
- September 2nd 2023 to February 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight "Snapshot 1" = $50 USD per Weight
- February 8th to March 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight Calculation "Snapshot 2" = $400 USD Per Weight
- March 8th to April 8th 2024 Implied Value of a Weight Calculation "Snapshot 3" = $641 USD per Weight

**NOTE: Weights are being rebased by 2,000 X this snap shot to create more granulatriy as fractions of weights are not supported in the Smart Contract.**

## Structuring your Code Contributions.
All Code Contributions should include the following five elements:
1. The Ethereum / Wallet address to be rewarded.
2. Link to the Issue being addressed.
3. Link to the Code Contribution.
4. Number of weights requested (just the # of weights don't include the word "weights").
5. Description of Contributions.

Example fields below: 

`| Wallet Address                             | Link to Issue | Link to Work        | Weights	| Description of Contribution |`    
`| 0x98eFf980C57c9D333340b3856481bF7B8698987c | Link to Issue | Link to Commit #127 | 50      |	Integration of ollama       |`  

Please include the "pipe" `|` symbol correctly as seen above so your contribution will format with the table.

> [!NOTE]
> - Create a pull request and add a row to the following table.  
> - If you are submitting multiple contributions, please create multiple pull requests - one pull request per contribution.  
> - Only add your link at the bottom, and do not alter any other rows.   
> - Detail the work you are contributing to Morpheus. You must include a link to the work for the work to be considered. Examples of proof include links to pull requests, github issues, or other easily verifyable information.  
> - It is your responsibility to make the proof easily verifiable. Don't assume reviewers of this table have an understanding of your code. Explain it simply. Limit your descriptions to 250 words.
> -  You need a wallet like Metamask that can receive Ethereum based tokens. MOR is an ERC-20 type token. Also must support Arbitrum.
